    <p id="strategy">NavStella Consulting LLC (“NavStella”, “we”, “us”) is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with us. NavStella has established this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the publicly available portion of NavStella.com (the “Site”) and through various other interactions with you, and how we may use and share that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site and/or providing us with Personal Information, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or provide us with any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect on the Site and to information which we may collect by other “offline” means, including, without limitation, sales calls and other business transactions. A description of the information we collect on behalf of our advertiser clients through our advertising services is set out in our Notice of Marketing Practices.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Personal Information</b></br>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home, business, or other physical address, a phone number, and an email address. We collect Personal Information from our Site users and customers only when such information is voluntarily provided to us, including, without limitation, in connection with inquiries about our services through the “Contact Us” page, as part of signing up for our email subscriptions, or in the process of your business transactions with us. To make our content more relevant to you, we may also ask for information about your present place of employment, such as company name, size, industry sector and number of employees. Of course, if you send us an email in connection with an inquiry about a job listed on the “Careers” page, we may also store the Personal Information provided in connection with that inquiry.</p>
    <p id="strategy">We also offer a variety of email subscriptions where you can get information about online marketing and promotions and special offers. You can subscribe to these emails and you can manage your email preferences. If you become a customer of NavStella, we will always retain the right to email you regarding the Site or services that we’re providing to you.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>How We May Use Your Information</b></br>If you provide us with Personal Information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes, including facilitating and otherwise addressing your inquiry, request, subscriptions, or business transactions and relationship with NavStella. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to respond to your questions or requests for information about NavStella. We may also use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Who We May Share Your Information With</b></br>We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Site and our e-mail services and processing inquiries. We may provide Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties. NavStella will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on NavStella’s behalf. NavStella will not sell or share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In the event that NavStella or all of its assets are acquired, all of the data collected by NavStella through the Site and through other means and services provided by NavStella would be among the transferred assets. We reserve the right to disclose such information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other visitors, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose such information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Non-Personal Information</b></br>From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as what sites visitors are coming from when they visit our Site, when they first visited our Site, their IP address, how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We may use the IP address to infer information about such visitor, including its company, city and state. We collect this information through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the site are most popular and to enhance the site for visitors. We may group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers, or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site.</p>
    <p id="strategy">If you have any questions regarding NavStella privacy practices, you are encouraged to contact NavStella at contact@NavStella.com.</p>           
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Links to Other Sites</b></br>Please be aware that when you are on the site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control via hyperlinks. You may be sent to a third-party website if you click on a hyperlink. These other websites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit Personal Information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected there.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Security</b></br>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to NavStella employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. For more information visit the Security page.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Children’s Privacy</b></br>This site is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b></br>The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
    <p id="strategy"><br><b>Governing Law</b></br>NavStella makes no representation that this Privacy Policy and such practices comply with the laws of any other country. Visitors who use the Site and reside outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent that local laws are applicable.
